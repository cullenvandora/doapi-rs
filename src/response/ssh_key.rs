// id               number      This is a unique identification number for the
// key. This can be used to reference a specific SSH key when you wish to embed
// a key into a Droplet.
// fingerprint      string      This attribute contains the fingerprint value
// that is generated from the public key. This is a unique identifier that will
// differentiate it from other keys using a format that SSH recognizes.
// public_key       string      This attribute contains the entire public key
// string that was uploaded. This is what is embedded into the root user's
// authorized_keys file if you choose to include this SSH key during Droplet
// creation.
// name             string      This is the human-readable display name for the
// given SSH key. This is used to easily identify the SSH keys when they are
// displayed.
